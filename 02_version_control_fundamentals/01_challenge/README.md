# Challenge 1: Version Control Fundamentals

## Introduction

This challenge is designed to test and enhance your understanding of Git version control system and GitHub. This challenge consists of a series of tasks that will require you to utilize various Git and GitHub features effectively. By completing this challenge, you will gain a solid foundation in Git and GitHub, essential skills for any developer or team working on software projects.

## Base Requirements

### Task 1: Setup the Project

1. Create a folder anywhere locally on your machine. Give it any name you like.
2. Open this folder in a code editor of your choice and initialize a Git repository inside it.
3. Configure your Git username and email.
4. Create a `README.md` file and add a brief introduction about yourself and your project.
5. Create the main file where you will be doing the changes. It can be of any type. We recommend an `html` file but it’s not required.

### Task 2: Tracking Changes

1. Stage the changes you made to the project so far. Submit your first commit with the message: `“Initial Commit”`.
2. Log the project history and take a screenshot. Rename the screenshot file to `screenshot_1` and save it in some folder called **screenshots** inside your project folder.
3. Add more changes to your project’s main file, stage and commit these changes. Set the commit message to whatever you like.
4. Repeat step 3.
5. Assume the changes you made in step 4 are unneeded. Undo Step 4 changes. Make sure you use the proper command to undo these changes completely (including deleting the commit from the project history)
6. Log the project history and take a screenshot. Rename the screenshot file to `screenshot_2` and save it in the **screenshots** folder in your project folder.
7. Add more changes to your project’s main file, stage and commit these changes. Set the commit message to whatever you like.
8. Repeat Step 7.
9. Undo the changes made in step 7. Make sure you use the proper command to undo these changes completely but **DO NOT** delete any commits.
10. Log the project history and take a screenshot. Rename the screenshot file to `screenshot_3` and save it in the **screenshots** folder in your project folder.

### Task 3: Creating a Remote Repository

1. Sign in to your GitHub account. If you don’t have any, create a new one.
2. Create a new repository on GitHub. Give it the same name you gave to your project local folder. Make sure to untick the option to create a `README` file since you already created one locally.
3. Link the newly created remote repository to your local one.
4. Run a command to ensure the remote repository has been linked successfully.
5. Take a screenshot of your terminal after your run the command on step 4. Rename the screenshot file to `screenshot_4` and save it in the **screenshots** folder in your project folder.
6. Run a command to make sure your project working tree is clean. (i.e: there are no untracked changes)
7. Push everything you have on the `main` branch to the remote GitHub repository.
8. Go to your GitHub repository account and edit the `README` file there. Save the changes and commit them on GitHub.
9. Now, your GitHub repository is ahead of your local one by 1 commit. To ensure they remain in sync, run a command to bring in the change you made on GitHub to your local repository.
10. Log the project history and take a screenshot. Rename the screenshot file to `screenshot_5` and save it in the **screenshots** folder in your project folder.
11. Stage and commit locally and push this final change to you GitHub repository
